# Why do we need calculators

## Introduction to calculators

Calculators are an essential tool for us in our daily lives. They can perform basic arithmetic, but also very complicated calculations.
They save us a lot of time and are reducing human errors, which is very important in fields like science or finance.

### Early calculating devices

Before electronic calculators people had to rely on manual calculation tools like the abacus and slide rule.
They helped workers but they were very slow.


## Types of calculators

There are many different calculator types with different purposes. 
Here are the most important ones with links to websites where you can use them: 

- [Basic calculators for simple arithmetic](https://www.calculatorsoup.com/calculators/math/basic.php)
- [Scientific calculators for advanced mathematical functions](https://www.desmos.com/scientific)
- [Financial calculators for business calculations](https://www.calculator.net/financial-calculator.html)
- [Graphing calculators for visual representation of functions](https://www.geogebra.org/graphing)

### Programming calculators

Modern calculators can even handle programming functions that make them a powerful tool for students, for example.
## The future of calculation

As technology advances, so do calculators. Artificial intelligence is being integrated into calculation tools and is one of the biggest human steps yet, that will maybe make every human obsolete in the future.

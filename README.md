# CalculatorSys.java

## Description
This program provides a simple interactive command-line calculator in Java. It asks the user to enter two numbers and an operator (+, -, *, /) and then performs the math-operation. It includes error handling for invalid inputs such as non-numeric values and ensures only positive numbers are accepted.

## Installation

### 1. Requirements:
Java Development Kit (JDK) version 8 or higher

### 2. Compile the code
Open your terminal and navigate to the directory containing `CalculatorSys.java` and compile the code using the following command:

```sh
javac CalculatorSys.java
```

## Usage
### 1. How to run the program
After you have compiled the code, run the program using:
```sh
java CalculatorSys
```

### 2. Input
The program will be asking for:
- First value (enter a non-negative valid double)
- Operator (allowed operators: +,-,*,/)
- Second value (enter a non-negative valid doubler)

All inputs must be in the correct format


### 3. Output
The program will display the result in this format:
```sh
[first number][operator][second number] = [result]
```

The result is formatted to show two decimal places.

Example:
```sh
Value 1: 10
Operator: *
Value 2: 10
10.0*10.0 = 100.00
```
